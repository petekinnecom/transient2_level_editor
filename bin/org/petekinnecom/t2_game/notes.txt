Todo:
	Gameplay:
		Find physics balance of gravity/acceleration/etc
		Fix collision detection: don't take average, take max.
		Capture ball death.
		Friction of vektors?
		Ball world switch:
			Get appropriate vektors
			Ball stuck in walls (dummy vektors)
		Smoother camera: lag behind a bit?
		
	GameStructure:
		Images for green/blue tiles?
		Moving walkways:
			entities extend tiles or tiles extend entities?
			where in the game loop fit in?
			Maybe *all* tiles can move?!?!?!?! 
			
	LevelEditor:
		Everything is currently saved as a tile. Perhaps LevelPieces should know
			how to write themselves to db?
